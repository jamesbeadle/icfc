        ICFC: Football Ownership for the Fans
    </p>
    
    <!-- --------------- Introduction --------------- -->
    
    <p class="text-xl cta-text">
        Introduction
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The OpenFPL DAO was initially developed using the FPL token for our fantasy football platform. 
        However, it has rapidly expanded into a broader ecosystem encompassing women’s fantasy football, community-driven governance, and a unique betting platform.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We believe the the next step on the road to decentralising football ownership for fans is rebrand our SNS from OpenFPL to ICFC (Internet Computer Football Club) and build a football club for the world. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        By using blockchain-based governance, ICFC empowers fans and stakeholders to participate in club decisions, from hiring managers to scouting players through a tokenised voting system, running 100% on a decentralised blockchain.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This whitepaper outlines the overarching vision, technological infrastructure, token economics, and long-term strategy for expanding our decentralised football infrastructure through <a href="https://icfc.app" target="_blank">icfc.app</a>.

    <p class="text-xl cta-text">
        A Purposeful Rebrand
    </p>

    <p>
        ICFC will act as the parent brand for our existing valuable football brands, providing a unified and consistent focal point for promotion. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The original OpenFPL name is closely associated with “Fantasy Premier League”, yet our project has evolved far beyond fantasy football, creating a governance backed dataset powering multiple football based applications. 
        This rebrand reflects our expanded focus on true football club governance, ensuring supporters have a stake in decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>ICFC Token Utility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Used for overall DAO governance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used for rewards in our 2 fantasy football games, OpenFPL & OpenWSL.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used to verify our 100% on-chain dataset along with reward people for ensuring this dataset is up to date.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used for betting with on Jeff Bets and burned if a bet loses.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used to purchase official ICFC trading cards on Transfer Kings.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        As our ecosystem grows and new features are introduced across our range of applications we will always look to utilise the ICFC token where possible to ensure any profits are ultimately returned to token holders.

        ICFC’s Mission: Redefining Football Governance
    </p>

    <p>
        Traditional football clubs are commonly governed by a small group of owners or directors, often sidelining the club’s real heartbeat - its supporters. 
        ICFC’s mission is to democratise football club ownership by enabling fans, players and community members to directly influence operational decisions. 
    </p>

    <p>Our Key Goals:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Ensure Club Success: Prove that decentralising the key decisions with fans will ultimately lead to club success through climbing the football pyramid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boost ICP Adoption & Value: Showcase a key ICP blockchain feature (SNS Governance) to drive large-scale user adoption, increasing ecosystem demand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhance Fan Engagement: Reward supporters for physically attending matches, strengthening loyalty and participation.
        </li>

        </li>
