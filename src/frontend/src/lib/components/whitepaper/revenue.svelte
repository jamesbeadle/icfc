    title="ICFC Revenue Streams"
    intro="Football is the biggest game on the planet, loved by billions and therefore highly lucrative. The ICFC has designed a range of revenue streams to benefit from expected user engagement with our ecosystem, whilst ensuring the redistribution of those profits to neuron holders.">

            Financial Projections 
        </p>

        <p>
            ICFC’s revenue model is thoughtfully designed to sustain and grow the DAO while ensuring practical utility and value for its users. Our financial projections are built around creating a complete football ecosystem, becoming a household name among fans positioned to provide users with valuable services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since our first decentralisation sale we have taken our product range from 1 to 6, providing token holders with a range of core applications and brands to promote our ecosystem. Now, we’re scaling up, acquiring a football club, finalising products and unlocking a number of revenue streams.
        </p>
    
        <p class="small-header">
            Diversified Revenue Model
        </p>
    
        <p>
            ICFC’s revenue streams are diversified to ensure no reliance on any single potentially volatile asset. This approach ensures the long term stability and utility of the DAO, putting it in the best position to fund on-going development and promotion.
