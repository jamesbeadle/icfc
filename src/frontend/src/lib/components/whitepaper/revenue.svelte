    title="ICFC Revenue Streams"
    intro="Football isn’t just a sport, it’s the biggest game on the planet. 
        With 4 BILLION fans and endless ways to monetise its data, passion and engagement">


        <p class="sub-header">
            Financial Projections 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Football is the most widely played and participated activity, uniting people across all ages, cultures and continents, in both organised and casual settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            ICFC is seizing this opportunity with a fully decentralised, real-time football ecosystem, built to generate continuous token demand and a range of revenue streams. 
            We’ve already invested in product development and team expansion using funds from our first success, OpenFPL. 
            Now, we’re scaling up, acquiring a football club, finalising products and unlocking a number of revenue streams.
        </p>
        <p>
            ICFC’s revenue model is thoughtfully designed to sustain and grow the DAO while ensuring practical utility and value for its users.
        </p>
    
        <p class="small-header">
            Diversified Revenue Model
        </p>
    
        <p>
            ICFC’s revenue streams are diversified to ensure no reliance on any single potentially volatile asset. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This approach ensures the long term stability and utility of the DAO, putting it in the best position to fund on-going development and promotion.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Our suite of products is designed to bring in revenue from in-application features centered around the ICFC & ICP utility token.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            These revenue streams include:
        </p>
    
        <ul class="space-y-4">
            <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Purchase of trading cards on Transfer Kings (ICFC)." />
            <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Private league revenue from OpenFPL and OpenWSL (ICFC)." />
