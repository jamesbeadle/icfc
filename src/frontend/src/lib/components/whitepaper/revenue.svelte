    </p>

    <p>
        Football isn’t just a sport, it’s the biggest game on the planet. 
        With 4 BILLION fans and endless ways to monetise its data, passion and engagement. 
        Football is the most widely played and participated activity, uniting people across all ages, cultures and continents, in both organised and casual settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        ICFC is seizing this opportunity with a fully decentralised, real-time football ecosystem, built to generate continuous token demand and a range of revenue streams. 
        We’ve already invested in product development and team expansion using funds from our first success, OpenFPL. 
        Now, we’re scaling up, acquiring a football club, finalising products and unlocking a number of revenue streams.
    </p>
    <p>
        ICFC’s revenue model is thoughtfully designed to sustain and grow the DAO while ensuring practical utility and value for its users.

    <p class="small-header">
        Diversified Revenue Model
    </p>

    <p>
        ICFC’s revenue streams are diversified to ensure no reliance on any single potentially volatile asset. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach ensures the long term stability and utility of the DAO, putting it in the best position to fund on-going development and promotion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our suite of products is designed to bring in revenue from in-application features centered around the ICFC & ICP utility token.

        These revenue streams include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Purchase of trading cards on Transfer Kings (ICFC).</li>
        <li>- Private league revenue from OpenFPL and OpenWSL (ICFC).</li>
