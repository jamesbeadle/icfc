        ICFC Apps: An Ecosystem Powered by Governance
    </p> 

    <p>
        Our ecosystem of applications run 100% on-chain with zero dependencies. This is acheived through owning our underlying dataset, validating it using the DAO's governance system.
        We have taken great care to create applications that have their own brands, ensuring they can form their own community within our football ecosystem.

        Governance Data: Football God
    </p>

    <p>
        Our project centers around our governance backed dataset powering our suite of applications, showcasing our committment to ensuring fans own every inch of their football ecosystem. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        ICFC maintains this comprehensive world football database utilising our governance data management platform, FootballGod. 
        This database serves as the backbone of ICFC’s digital ecosystem, providing a governance-backed, continuously updated repository of football intelligence. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond ICFC’s own applications, other ecosystem apps can integrate FootballGod’s dataset by purchasing API access, ensuring that the governance-backed intelligence collected by the ICFC community becomes a valuable, revenue-generating asset. 
        This model allows third-party developers, football analysts, fantasy football platforms and sports betting applications to tap into an unparalleled football data resource, reinforcing ICFC’s position at the forefront of decentralised football intelligence.   
    </p>

    <p>
        We plan to utilise our football dataset to train an AI to extend and backfill all of football data, for all leagues, for all of time. We aim for FootballGod to know everything about football, hold this data on-chain and power more and more new fan based experiences.

        Betting: Jeff Bets
    </p>

    <p>
        At the core of ICFC’s economic stability is a revolutionary burning mechanism designed to offset in-game rewards, powered by our very own fixed-odds betting platform, Jeff Bets (gambling license pending). But this isn’t just another betting platform. Jeff is the world’s first AI betting agent. Unlike traditional betting platforms where users manually place bets, Jeff autonomously bets on your behalf using advanced statistical pattern recognition, mirroring your usual strategies but with the precision and speed only AI can deliver. Jeff isn’t an algorithm. Jeff is an intelligent betting companion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jeff isn’t only about numbers, he’s your football conversation partner. Imagine chatting to Jeff about match predictions, discussing team form, debating transfers, or even crafting custom betting rules based on thoughtful discussions. This is betting in its most engaging, interactive form. Not just transactions, but experiences.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We’ve entered a world where AI-powered systems operate at levels designed to maximise user enjoyment. With Jeff, betting becomes a dynamic, intelligent process. Merging AI, social interaction and cutting-edge technology  - creating a new way to experience sports betting.
