</p>

<p class="text-xs">
    Note: Free Bets on Jeff Bets
</p>

<p class="text-xs">
    Free bets will be 1% of the total bets placed on Jeff Bets. This 1% will be placed into a free bet pool and then distributed to the number of players based on their membership. A month where more bets are placed will result in an increased value in the betting pool as the amount of ICFC placed is greater. 
</p>
        

<p>
    ICFC’s membership-based revenue model is structured around staking-based access, ensuring that governance is community-driven while also generating revenue through token utility.
Membership Structure & Staking Requirements
Monthly Membership: Requires staking 1,000 ICFC for the maximum duration.
Seasonal Membership (July - August): Requires staking 10,000 ICFC for the maximum duration.
Lifetime Membership: Requires staking 100,000 ICFC (linked to an Internet Identity neuron).

Membership numbers will change as the ICFC token value & supply shift. This creates a self-regulating system where participation is linked to market demand.

ICFC memberships do more than grant access - they drive real value by locking up tokens, making them rarer and more valuable. Staking isn’t just about holding - it gives fans a voice in club decisions, transfers and strategy. As membership grows, so does the club’s financial strength, creating a self-sustaining football economy. More fans, more influence, more value. ICFC is a club powered by its supporters.
