    Note: Free Bets on Jeff Bets
</p>

<p class="text-xs">
    Free bets will be 1% of the total bets placed on Jeff Bets. This 1% will be placed into a free bet pool and then distributed to the number of players based on their membership. A month where more bets are placed will result in an increased value in the betting pool as the amount of ICFC placed is greater.
