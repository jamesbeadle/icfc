        Note: Free Bets on Jeff Bets
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-xs">
        Free bets will be 1% of the total bets placed on Jeff Bets. This 1% will be placed into a free bet pool and then distributed to the number of players based on their membership. A month where more bets are placed will result in an increased value in the betting pool as the amount of ICFC placed is greater.

    Membership numbers will change as the ICFC token value & supply shift. This creates a self-regulating system where participation is linked to market demand.
    
    ICFC memberships do more than grant access - they drive real value by locking up tokens, making them rarer and more valuable. Staking isn’t just about holding - it gives fans a voice in club decisions, transfers and strategy. As membership grows, so does the club’s financial strength, creating a self-sustaining football economy. More fans, more influence, more value. ICFC is a club powered by its supporters.
