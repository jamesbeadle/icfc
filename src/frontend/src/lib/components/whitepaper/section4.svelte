        Decentralisation Sale 2: Financial Focus
    </p> 

    <p>
        A swap will occur throughout April 2025, if successful, decentralising 25% of the ICFC platform. 
    </p>

    <p>
        ICFC operates as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) with a structured financial model:
    </p>

    <p>
        The DAO will hold cryptocurrency balance of Bitcoin (ckBTC), ICP and ICFC tokens along with any user ICRC token assets deposited into our ecosystem for our range of football based applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Waterway Labs provides foundational support to the ICFC ecosystem, controlling around 5% of the token supply through their developer neuron. Their main focus is to add value to the ICFC ecosystem, targeting the distribution of profits to ICFC staked neuron holders.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along with ensuring the delivery of software, Waterway Labs also ensures execution of strategic growth initiatives.
    </p>

    <p>
        Waterway Labs will legally own any football clubs acquired and will be responsible for generating profits and reinvesting back into club development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Football isn’t just a sport, it’s the biggest game on the planet. 
        With 4 BILLION fans and endless ways to monetise its data, passion and engagement. 
        Football is the most widely played and participated activity, uniting people across all ages, cultures and continents, in both organised and casual settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        ICFC is seizing this opportunity with a fully decentralised, real-time football ecosystem, built to generate continuous token demand and a range of revenue streams. 
        We’ve already invested in product development and team expansion using funds from our first success, OpenFPL. 
        Now, we’re scaling up, acquiring a football club, finalising products and unlocking a number of revenue streams.

    <p>
        ICFC’s revenue streams are diversified to ensure no reliance on any single potentially volatile asset. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach ensures the long term stability and utility of the DAO, putting it in the best position to fund on-going development and promotion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our suite of products is designed to bring in revenue from in-application features centered around the ICFC & ICP utility token.
    </p>

    <p>
        These revenue streams include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Purchase of trading cards on Transfer Kings (ICFC).</li>
        <li>- Private league revenue from OpenFPL and OpenWSL (ICFC).</li>

        RWA Acquisition 
    </p>

    <p>
        The largest use of funds will be to purchase a UK football club through a broker here in the UK to run through the ICFC DAO.
    </p>

    <p>
        For clubs acquired by ICFC, their revenue streams will remain fully with each club. 
        If additional financial support is needed, ICFC will aim to provide direct cash injections into the clubs rather than reallocating existing revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach ensures that each club retains financial independence and continues to reinvest in its own growth and success, 
        while still benefiting from the strategic support provided by ICFC.
