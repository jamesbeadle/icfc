    <p class="small-header">
        RWA Acquisition 
    </p>

    <p>
        The largest use of funds will be to purchase a UK football club through a broker here in the UK to run through the ICFC DAO.
    </p>

    <p>
        For clubs acquired by ICFC, their revenue streams will remain fully with each club. 
        If additional financial support is needed, ICFC will aim to provide direct cash injections into the clubs rather than reallocating existing revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach ensures that each club retains financial independence and continues to reinvest in its own growth and success, 
        while still benefiting from the strategic support provided by ICFC.
