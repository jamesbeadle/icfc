    title="Decentralisation Sale 2: Financial Focus"
    intro="A swap will occur throughout April 2025, if successful, decentralising 25% of the ICFC platform.">


    <p>
        ICFC operates as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) with a structured financial model:
    </p>

    <p>
        The DAO will hold cryptocurrency balance of Bitcoin (ckBTC), ICP and ICFC tokens along with any user ICRC token assets deposited into our ecosystem for our range of football based applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Waterway Labs provides foundational support to the ICFC ecosystem, controlling around 5% of the token supply through their developer neuron. Their main focus is to add value to the ICFC ecosystem, targeting the distribution of profits to ICFC staked neuron holders.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along with ensuring the delivery of software, Waterway Labs also ensures execution of strategic growth initiatives.
    </p>

    <p>
        Waterway Labs will legally own any football clubs acquired and will be responsible for generating profits and reinvesting back into club development.
    </p>

        Token Lockup & Vesting 
    </p>

    <p>
        Tokens are securely locked in five non-dissolving neurons with a staggered release schedule ranging from six months to a 2.5-year delay. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When fully dissolved, liquid ICFC tokens are added to your ICFC wallet balance. Participants can log into the ICFC platform to track the dissolution of their ICFC neurons, confirming the amount that becomes liquid.
    </p>

        RWA Acquisition 
    </p>

    <p>
        The largest use of funds will be to purchase a UK football club through a broker here in the UK to run through the ICFC DAO.
    </p>

    <p>
        For clubs acquired by ICFC, their revenue streams will remain fully with each club. 
        If additional financial support is needed, ICFC will aim to provide direct cash injections into the clubs rather than reallocating existing revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach ensures that each club retains financial independence and continues to reinvest in its own growth and success, 
        while still benefiting from the strategic support provided by ICFC.
