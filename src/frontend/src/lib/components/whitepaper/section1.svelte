        ICFC's Mission
    </p>

    <p>
        Traditional football clubs are commonly governed by a small group of owners or directors, often sidelining the club’s real heartbeat - its supporters. ICFC’s mission is to democratise football club ownership by enabling fans, players and community members to directly influence operational decisions.
