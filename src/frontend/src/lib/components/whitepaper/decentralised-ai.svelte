        Decentralised AI

    <p class="small-header">
        Overview
    </p>

    <p>
        The ICFC ecosystem, built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), harnesses the
        governance-backed Football God dataset to lead in decentralised football ownership.
        This plan introduces two key AI-driven features, utilizing in-house developed large
        language models (LLMs), analytical models, simulators, and predictive models,
        contingent on securing future resources. These innovations will set ICFC apart from
        other blockchain projects.

        AI Features
    </p>
    
    <p>
        1. Conversational AI for Jeff Bets
    </p>

    <p>
        This feature integrates an in-house developed conversational LLM into Jeff Bets
        to enable real-time interactions with fans. The AI will discuss match predictions,
        suggest custom betting rules, and adjust odds based on insights from the Football God
        dataset and external inputs like X posts, enhancing the platform’s interactive appeal
        and aligning with the revolutionary burning mechanism.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will implement these features by:
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-4">
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Develop and train an in-house LLM on football-specific data from Football God and betting patterns, ensuring compliance with the pending gambling license." />
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Upgrade ICP canisters to support real-time conversational workloads, utilizing the platform’s HTTP-serving capabilities." />
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Create a user-friendly chat interface integrated into ICFC for seamless access across devices." />
    </ul>

    <p>
        Unlike other blockchain betting platforms, such as those on Ethereum,
        Jeff Bets offers on-chain AI with no user fees, leveraging ICP’s reverse gas model
        and unique burning mechanism to stabilise ICFC supply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        2. Data Capture, Analytics, Predictions, and Simulations
    </p>
    

    <p>
        This feature deploys in-house developed analytical models, simulators, and
        predictive models to analyse every match, player statistic, and fan input from the
        ecosystem (e.g., OpenFPL, OpenWSL, Transfer Kings). The AI will backfill historical
        data, simulate “what-if” scenarios like “What if Ronaldo joined your club in 2010?”, and
        provide data-driven insights for sub-DAO governance decisions such as transfers,
        manager hires, and facility upgrades, with results showcased in the planned TV
        documentary.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will implement these features by:
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-4">
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Develop in-house models to extend Football God with comprehensive stats for all leagues and eras, using generative techniques to fill data gaps." />
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Collaborate with DFINITY to enhance ICP subnets, exploring the potential for GPU-based nodes to boost computational power." />
        <HeaderContentSection title='' content="Build on-chain tools allowing fans to interact with simulations, integrated into ICFC and sub-DAO dashboards." />
    </ul>

    <p>

        Edge: No other DAO on ICP or any blockchain possesses a dataset as rich and
        fan owned as Football God. The on-chain AI capacity, potentially enhanced by
        GPU nodes, delivers real-time, bias-free analytics using Retrieval-Augmented
        Generation (RAG), outmatching centralised or less scalable competitors.
