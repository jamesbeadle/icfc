                Jeff Bets Conversational AI
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversational AI experiences are the natural progression for the medium in which users interact with applications. 
                We are focused on this next generation of user experience, beginning with introducing our first AI agent within the Jeff Bets platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jeff Bets is designed to use an in-house developed conversational LLM to enable a completely new way for football fans to bet. 
                Fans will be able to have a more natural conversation around football, identifying key patterns to bet on rather than just picking attractive odds. 
                This new way of betting gives fans the experience of not knowing which bets will be placed and the excitement of knowing when they are, it's based of a pattern they've predicted.

                OpenFPL Assistant Manager
            </p>

            <p>
                After we have setup our first AI on Jeff Bets we would look to create an assistant manager agent within our fantasy football apps, allowing users to more naturally obtain and utilise football statistics when setting up their fantasy football team.

                Jeff Bets Allowable Stake Calculation
            </p>

            <p>
                We will use AI to more precisely predict the amount of ICFC that can be wagered at any one time. This figure can be far more accurate using an AI's ability to check all possible result combination payout totals in relation to each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                This will enable Jeff Bets to provide attractive yet safe system betting limits, ensure token holders are protected.

                Tokenomics AI
            </p>

            <p>
                We will develop an ecosystem AI bot that will manage the varied and complex tokenomic levers availabe to the DAO. This bot will manage token unlock schedules, when to burn or buy ICFC to ensure our token supply is kept and a level in the best interest of token holders.

            The primary challenge is computational power, as ICP’s current architecture is CPU based computation nodes.
            mplement off-chain pre-training with on-chain inference to optimize resources, while advocating for GPU-based nodes with DFINITY to future-proof the system, pending resource availability.

            As the Internet Computer blockchain advances it's AI tooling we will utilise new features within our real world use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            Collaborate with ecosystem partners to enhance ICP subnets, exploring the potential for GPU-based nodes to boost computational power.
            Upgrade ICP canisters to support real-time conversational workloads, utilizing the platform’s HTTP-serving capabilities.

            Waterway Labs will leverage in-house expertise to build and refine LLMs, analytical & predictive models to work towards produces truly decentralised AI, runninng 100% on-chain.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            By ensuring all of our data is completely on-chain, verified by the DAO we have a competitive edge by owning the data and executing in-house AI on-chain. This surpasses projects reliant on centralised data or off-chain processing.
