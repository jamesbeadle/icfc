        The ICFC Token
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We utilise the ICFC token throughout our ecosystem to ensure that we can balance the DAO's token supply through the online services we offer.
    </p>

    <p class="small-header">Governance Rewards</p>

    <p>
        At the core of our ecosystem is a governance backed dataset. This new ownership paradigm ensures a generous amount of ICFC rewards for staked ICFC neuron holders. 
        These rewards are minted, adding to the total token supply.  
    </p>

    <p class="small-header">Burning</p>

    <p>
        To ensure the maximum control over the ICFC token supply we have designed our ecosystem to ensure we can always burn the token supply down to the starting amount, 100M ICFC tokens.
        To do this we have ensured that our expected highest revenue raising application, Jeff Bets, only utilises the ICFC token and burns losing bet stakes, effectively redistributing the betting profits to the DAO's token holders.
    </p>

    <p class="small-header">Minting</p>

    <p>
        Based on the tokens being burned through Jeff Bets the ICFC DAO is able to provide liquidity for prize pools for applications like OpenFPL and OpenWSL. 
        These prize pool amounts give us another tokenomic lever to pull if needed, whether to control supply or increase rewards for promotional purposes.

        Note Free Bets on JeffBets
    </p>

    <p class="text-xs">
        Free bets will be 1% of the total bets placed on JeffBets. This 1% will be placed into a free bet pool and then distributed to the number of players based on their membership. A month where more bets are placed will result in an increased value in the betting pool as the amount of FPL placed is greater.
