    ICFC is redefining the football landscape, shifting ownership and governance directly into the hands of fans, players and communities. Our model provides: 
    
    Empowered Community: Fans become stakeholders, making key club decisions. 
    Transparent Operations: On-chain governance eliminates secrecy. 
    Sustainable Growth: Long-term incentives ensure stability. 
    
    ICFC is more than a platform - itâ€™s a movement. Visit icfc.app to join the revolution and help shape the future of football governance.
